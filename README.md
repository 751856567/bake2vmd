# bake2vmd

A little tool to bake physics animation(work with mmd_tools:https://github.com/powroupi/blender_mmd_tools).

Because the blender 2.8's mmd_tools is too slow with physcis,so I write this addons to bake physics animation to MMD type armature,
then you can export the bone animation by .vmd file.Then you can use it in MMD or blender 2.8 without physics.Enjoy it!

# How to use it
